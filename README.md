# About
Hello folks, this repository is about a Sample UI using:
* HTML5

This code is for education purpose only - so IÂ´m believe that's we have a lot of code to improve.

* Open your MySQL Workbench - connect on your local database
* Open the Script located inside the "sql" folder on this project
* Run
* Open your internet browser
